## Hi there! I'm Hwang SooYeon👋

I'm a web frontend developer using react, vue.js 🚀<br>
I like to create a service that connect people.🧑‍🤝‍🧑<br>
When working on one project, I think of UI, and UX and try to provide services that can be convenient and comfortable for users. 💚 <br>

😆 I hope to develop a service that makes people laugh. 😆<br>
While working on the project with various people, I had an attitude to challenge and enjoy it first rather than being afraid of what I didn't try.🔥
